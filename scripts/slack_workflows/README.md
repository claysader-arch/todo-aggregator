# Slack AI Summary Workflow

Automated daily summaries of your Slack conversations using Slack AI, written to a Canvas for aggregation.

## Prerequisites

- Slack Enterprise+ plan (includes Slack AI)
- Access to Workflow Builder
- A Canvas to write summaries to

## Limitations

**Important:** The built-in "Summarize public channel" step only works with **public channels**. For private channels and DMs, you have two options:

1. **Manual approach:** Use Slack AI's native "Summarize this conversation" in private channels and manually copy to Canvas
2. **Bot approach:** Create a Slack app with appropriate permissions (more complex, Phase 3B)

For this workflow, we'll start with public channels which covers most team activity.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create the Target Canvas

1. In Slack, click **+** next to any channel name
2. Select **Canvas**
3. Name it: `AI Daily Summaries`
4. Add a header: `# Slack AI Summary`
5. Save the Canvas
6. Copy the Canvas link (click **...** → **Copy link**)
7. Note the Canvas ID from the URL (e.g., `F08ABC123XYZ`)

### Step 2: Create the Daily Summary Workflow

1. Click **Tools** in the Slack sidebar (or **More** → **Automations**)
2. Click **Workflows** → **New** → **Build workflow**
3. In the AI prompt box, type:
   ```
   Every weekday at 8am, summarize the last 24 hours from #general and update the canvas "AI Daily Summaries"
   ```
4. Click the paper plane icon to submit
5. Slack will generate a workflow - review the steps

### Step 3: Customize the Workflow

The generated workflow should have:

1. **Trigger:** Scheduled - Weekdays at 8:00 AM
2. **Step 1:** Summarize public channel
   - Channel: #general (or your primary channel)
   - Duration: Last 24 hours
3. **Step 2:** Update a canvas
   - Canvas: AI Daily Summaries
   - Content: Insert the `{Summary}` variable

**To add more channels:**

1. Click **Add step**
2. Search for **Summarize public channel**
3. Select another channel
4. Add another **Update a canvas** step with that summary

### Step 4: Configure Canvas Output Format

For the "Update a canvas" step, set the content to:

```
---

## Daily Summary - {{current_date}}

### #{{channel_name}}
{{Summary}}

**Generated by Slack AI**
```

Use the **Insert variable** button to add:
- `{Summary}` - The AI-generated summary
- `{current_date}` - Today's date

### Step 5: Publish and Test

1. Click **Finish Up**
2. Give it a name: `Daily AI Summary`
3. Click **Publish**
4. Click **Run once** to test immediately
5. Check your Canvas for the output

## Multi-Channel Workflow

To summarize multiple channels, create a workflow with this structure:

```
Trigger: Every weekday at 8:00 AM

Step 1: Summarize #engineering (24 hours)
Step 2: Update canvas with engineering summary

Step 3: Summarize #product (24 hours)
Step 4: Update canvas with product summary

Step 5: Summarize #general (24 hours)
Step 6: Update canvas with general summary

Step 7: (Optional) Send DM notification
```

---

## Weekly Review Workflow (Optional)

Create a second workflow:

1. **Trigger:** Every Friday at 4:00 PM
2. **Steps:**
   - Summarize each channel (last 7 days)
   - Update canvas with weekly section

Use this prompt:
```
Every Friday at 4pm, summarize the last 7 days from #general, #engineering, and #product, then update the canvas "AI Daily Summaries" with a weekly review section
```

## Canvas Format for Aggregator

The Canvas should follow this structure for optimal parsing by the todo aggregator:

```markdown
# Slack AI Summary

---

## Daily Summary - December 3, 2025

### #engineering
The team discussed the API migration strategy. Key points:
- Clay will draft the migration plan by Friday
- Sarah raised concerns about backwards compatibility
- Decision: Use versioned endpoints

### #product
Sprint planning completed. Dashboard feature prioritized for Q1.

---

## Daily Summary - December 2, 2025

### #engineering
Bug fixes deployed. Performance improved 20%.

---
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow doesn't run
- Check the schedule settings
- Verify you have Workflow Builder access
- Ensure Slack AI is enabled for your workspace

### Canvas not updating
- Verify the Canvas exists and is accessible
- Check the workflow has permission to update it
- Try running the workflow manually

### Summary is empty
- The channel may have had no activity in the time period
- Try a longer duration (e.g., 7 days instead of 24 hours)

---

## Next Steps

Once the workflow is running and writing to Canvas:

1. Note the Canvas ID from the URL
2. Add it to your `.env` file: `SLACK_CANVAS_ID=F08ABC123XYZ`
3. Proceed with Phase 3B: Building the SlackClient to read from this Canvas
